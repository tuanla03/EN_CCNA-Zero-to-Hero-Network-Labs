*Note: Basic settings from previous labs are omitted to focus on this lab. I highly recommend you configure them manually to keep your skills sharp! "Efficiency first! :)"*

VLAN 1 is the default vlan, so we don't need to create it and can't change its name.

"Stand in Global Config Mode"

vlan 2

name Sales

vlan 3 - We can move between VLAN Config Mode without going back to Global Config Mode.

name Guest

Next thing we are going to do is assign VLAN to the appropriate interface.

"Stand in Global Config Mode"

int e0/1

switchport mode access

switchport access vlan 1

int e0/2

switchport mode access

switchport access vlan 2

int e0/3

switchport mode access

switchport access vlan 3

exit

ip routing - enable routing on a Layer 3 Switch.

int vlan 1 - create a Switched Virtual Interface (SVI) for Inter-VLAN routing.

ip add 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0 - assign an ip address to this virtual interface.

no shut - Same as router interface, its default setting is shutdown.

int vlan 2 - Ofcourse we can move between Interface Config Mode without going back to the Global Config Mode.

ip add 192.168.2.1 255.255.255.0

no shut

int vlan 3

ip add 192.168.3.1 255.255.255.0

no shut

exit

You may notice that you can ping to other VLAN ip but can't ping to the equivalent VPCs. Don't worry, if you could ping to the other VLAN ip; it tells that the "ip routing" command works properly. 

The configuration is technically correct and verified. However, potential software bugs in EVE-NG may cause this error, i also try the same setup and it works perfectly in Cisco Packet Tracer 😉.
