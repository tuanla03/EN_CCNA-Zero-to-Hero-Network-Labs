*Note: Basic settings from previous labs are omitted to focus on VLAN, Trunk port and VTP. I highly recommend you configure them manually to keep your skills sharp! "Efficiency first! :)"*

We only configure trunk port on the interfaces between switch to ensure the confidentiality of our network. Just thing if a guy can access to multiple VLANs of your network, he can change his ip to match that network and so that he can access to other devices.

SW1

"Stand in Global Config Mode"

int e0/0

switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q

switchport mode trunk

exit

----------

SW2

"Stand in Global Config Mode"

int e0/0

switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q

switchport mode trunk

exit

int e0/1

switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q

switchport mode trunk

exit

Now SW1 and SW2 can share vtp packet to each other via trunk port to synchronize VLAN database.
