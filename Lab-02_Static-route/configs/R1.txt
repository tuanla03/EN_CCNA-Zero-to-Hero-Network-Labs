*I encourage you to set up the hostname, password, and other basic settings as practiced in Lab-01. However, for the sake of brevity, I’ll just focus "strictly" on the routing configuration 😉*

enable

configure terminal

interface e0/1

ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0

no shutdown

exit

interface e0/0

ip address 192.168.12.1 255.255.255.0

no shutdown

exit

ip route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.12.2

ip route 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.12.2

ip route 192.168.23.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.12.2 - In case you want to reach the R3 or the 23 network.

exit

write - Save the config
