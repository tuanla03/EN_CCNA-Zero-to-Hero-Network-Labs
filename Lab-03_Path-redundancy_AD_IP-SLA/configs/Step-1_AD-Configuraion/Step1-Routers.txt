*Note: Basic settings from previous labs are omitted to focus on IP SLA and Redundancy. I highly recommend you configure them manually to keep your skills sharp! "Efficiency first! :)"*

In this step we only use VPC1 and VPC5; R1 and R5

R1

ip route 192.168.5.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.15.2 5 - AD = 5 so R1 will prioritize choosing this path when it want to reach 192.168.5.0/24.

ip route 192.168.5.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.51.2 10 - AD = 10 so if the route to R5 via e1/0 is down, it will automatically choose this path.

R5

ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.15.1

ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.51.1
