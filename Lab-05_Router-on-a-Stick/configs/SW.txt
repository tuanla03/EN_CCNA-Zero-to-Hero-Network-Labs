*Note: Basic settings from previous labs are omitted to focus on this lab. I highly recommend you configure them manually to keep your skills sharp! "Efficiency first! :)"*

In this switch, we'll create the VLAN 2 and VLAN 3 ( VLAN 1 is the default VLAN ). Then configure a trunk link between the switch and the router to transmit data of multiple VLANs and ofcourse configure the interfaces connected to the VPCs to access port with the appropriate VLAN.

"Stand in Global Config Mode"

vlan 2

vlan 3

exit

do show vlan - To verify your configuration. ( we use "do" before the show command to execute it in Global Config Mode )

interface e0/1

switchport mode access

switchport access vlan 1

interface e0/2 - There is no need to exit to the Global Config Mode, we can move between VLAN Config Mode directly.

switchport mode access

switchport access vlan 2

int e0/3 - Note that we can write a shorter version of the command as well as the IOS could understand :)

switchport mode access

switchport access vlan 3

exit

int e0/0

switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q

switchport mode trunk

exit

To verify it, we use:

"Stand in Privilege EXEC Mode"

show vlan - to see if the VLAN are assign to the appropriate interfaces

sh int tr - as i mention before, we can write a shorter version of the command. So the fully command is "show interfaces trunk", use it to verify that we configured trunking link in the correct interface.
